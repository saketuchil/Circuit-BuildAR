# Circuit-BuildAR
"Circuit BuildAR" is an application that provides a virtual environment for students to practice electric circuitry. Electric components can be printed to paper cards and can be brought to life using Augmented Reality.
Real world 3D models of each component are augmented upon the corresponding paper cuttings. Users can design circuits, interact with components, customize their properties and also simulate and test their circuits easily. This app is a much more safer and eco-friendly environment to work on.
Circuit BuildAR is developed in Unity 3D game engine along with Vuforia which is a plugin supported by Unity for Augmented Reality.
